summary: low cost embedded vision system for the detection of 1D barcodes
abstract: |
  In the trend of miniaturization and smart systems/devices, many industries are still working with comparatively large and costly computer-based system as compared to embedded systems. The work discussed in the paper focuses on development on a small, low-cost, less power-consuming embedded vision-based one-dimensional barcode detection and decoding system by fusion of camera and embedded system. 1D barcodes are prevalent in retail, pharma, automobile, and many other industries for automatic product identification. Real-time application of 1D barcode localization and decoding algorithm in Python using OpenCV library was developed. Image processing task will be performed by embedded systems, which proves that the performance of embedded systems is comparable to a computer. Results of barcode detection and computation time comparison over different hardware platforms are discussed in the results.
