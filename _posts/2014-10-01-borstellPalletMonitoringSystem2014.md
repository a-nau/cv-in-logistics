summary: System for pallet monitoring
abstract: Increased transparency of material and product flows in warehouses will
  necessitate real-time determination of the properties of logistical units (e.g.
  small bins, parcels, palletized goods, intermodal containers). The key properties
  of logistical units are their unique identifiers and locations at a given time.
  Other properties such as dimensions, weight or temperature may also be relevant,
  depending on the use case. This paper presents a pallet monitoring system that determines
  the characteristics of pallets, namely storage location, storage time, dimensions
  and appearance. Technically, this is done by combining the MarLO vehicle positioning
  system that employs passive planar markers, an RFID identification system, a dimensioning
  system that employs depth sensors and a load change detection system mounted on
  vehicles. The proposed approach was developed and evaluated in a real world test
  bed. This enabled us to transfer the subsystems' accuracy to our new pallet monitoring
  system, i.e. we achieved a pallet positioning accuracy of up to 10 cm, a pallet
  dimensioning accuracy of up to 5 cm in each dimension and highly accurate pallet
  identification. By fusing the data from these subsystems, we were able to generate
  the aforementioned pallet information for subsequent monitoring and control of warehouse
  operations in real-time.
