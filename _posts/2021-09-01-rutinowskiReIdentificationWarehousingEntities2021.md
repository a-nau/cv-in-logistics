summary: re-identification for chipwood pallet blocks of Euro pallets
abstract: This paper contributes a new dataset, namely for the re-identification of Euro-pallet pallet-blocks, called pallet-block-502. Based on a logistics use case, three re-identification algorithms are benchmarked on this dataset. The dataset constitutes 502 pallet-blocks, of which ten pictures each are taken, expanding the dataset to a grand total of 5,020 images. The preliminary results of this work indicate the reliable re-identification of pallet-blocks using the Part-based Convolutional Baseline (PCB) network with ResNet50 as its backbone network, achieving an mAP of 98\%.
