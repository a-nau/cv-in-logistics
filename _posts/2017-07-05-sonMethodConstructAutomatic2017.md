summary: ''
abstract: The measurement of the bounding-box size of a particular object in logistic
  system is critical. It consumes very much effort of the agents when processing a
  new order. Therefore reducing the performance of the agents. This paper introduces
  a method for measuring size of object bounding-box using multiple 3D cameras. These
  cameras will be arranged around the object such that they can view the whole of
  object. The object then will be reconstructed in three dimensions using output data
  that captured by the sensors. There are some of 3D processing techniques used to
  do this. Finally a bounding box will be computed to illustrate the size of the object.
  Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and the performance
  of the introduced method.
