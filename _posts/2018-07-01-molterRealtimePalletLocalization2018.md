summary: pallet detection and localization using a time-of-flight camera
abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for detection and localization of standardized euro pallets, which are orientated up to 90Â° in relation to the sensor plane. There is no a priori information about the pallets pose needed. We use a time-of-flight camera. Our algorithm is based on finding surfaces in the point cloud, which represent the three wooden blocks of a euro pallet. Different kinds of geometrical checks set up our detection pipeline, where no artificial markers on the pallets are needed. Since we perform the detection while driving a forklift, the algorithm must process the point cloud within a set time limit. The detection and localization result in the pallets position and orientation in relation to the camera coordinate system. This information can be provided to higher-level systems, like advanced driver assistance systems. The results show that the localization of pallets is possible in the scenario considered.
