summary: Digital measuring and load planning for large, regularly shaped wooden assets.
abstract: Recently, the efforts involved in the digitization and digitalization of logistics processes have grown tremendously. In line with such efforts, we investigate the potential of the process-integrated measuring and load planning of large transport assets. More precisely, considering the case of a German timber processor and retailer, we implement a digital measuring system, which performs precise measuring of regularly shaped wooden assets. The cognitive system uses laser and vision sensors, and measurements can be performed during the asset’s transportation on a forklift. The resulting data can be used to conduct a comprehensive load planning for scheduled delivery tours.
