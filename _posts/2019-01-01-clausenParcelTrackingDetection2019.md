summary: industry scale approach for tracking parcels in a logistics facility.
abstract: Inside parcel distribution hubs, several tenth of up 100 000 parcels processed each day get lost. Human operators have to tediously recover these parcels by searching through large amounts of video footage from the installed large-scale camera network. We want to assist these operators and work towards an automatic solution. The challenge lies both in the size of the hub with a high number of cameras and in the adverse conditions. We describe and evaluate an industry scale tracking framework based on state-of-the-art methods such as Mask R-CNN. Moreover, we adapt a siamese network inspired feature vector matching with a novel feature improver network, which increases tracking performance. Our calibration method exploits a calibration parcel and is suitable for both overlapping and non-overlapping camera views. It requires little manual effort and needs only a single drive-by of the calibration parcel for each conveyor belt. With these methods, most parcels can be tracked start-to-end.
