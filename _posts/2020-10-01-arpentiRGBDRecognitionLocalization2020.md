summary: optimized depalletization using a single RGBD camera
abstract: Integrating a robotic system into the depalletizing process of a supermarket demands a high level of autonomy, based on strong perceptive capabilities. This paper presents a system for detection, recognition, and localization of heterogeneous cases in a depalletizing robotic cell, using a single RGB-D camera. Such a system integrates apriori information on the content of the pallet with data from the RGB-D camera, exploiting a sequence of 2D and 3D model-based computer-vision algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is assessed in an experiment where multiple cases and pallet configurations are considered. Finally, a complete depalletizing process is shown.
