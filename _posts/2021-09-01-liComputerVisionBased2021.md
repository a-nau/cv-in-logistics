summary: recognize congestions on conveyor belts
abstract: Various automatic and intelligent technologies have been employed to facilitate
  the logistics operations in recent years promoted by the trend of industry 4.0.
  As the most frequently used automatic equipment in the logistics industrial parks,
  conveyor belt plays a critical role on the efficient sorting of packages. Due to
  the reasons like non-ideality of scheduling and inappropriate operations, conveyor
  belts can potentially be impacted by congestion, thereby inducing a series of consequences
  such as delay, lose and damage of packages. In order to tackle these issues, a computer
  vision-based method is proposed to recognize the congestion on conveyor belts. Other
  than the popular deep learning-based techniques, the proposed method comprehensively
  analyzes the characteristics of conveyor belt congestion using statistical approaches
  and extract informative features for decision making. Finally, the proposed method
  is evaluated on the data collected from real package sorting scenarios, where it
  outperforms the deep learning and conventional pattern recognition-based methods
  on both detection accuracy and capability of generalization.
