summary: pallet detection and localization for an autonomous forklift using a stereo
  camera
abstract: The paper presents a method for automatically detecting pallets and estimating
  their position and orientation. For detection we use a sliding window approach with
  efficient candidate generation, fast integral features and a boosted classifier.
  Specific information regarding the detection task such as region of interest, pallet
  dimensions and pallet structure can be used to speed up and validate the detection
  process. Stereo reconstruction is employed for depth estimation by applying Semi-Global
  Matching aggregation with Census descriptors. Offline test results show that successful
  detection is possible under 0.5 seconds.
