summary: estimating the volume of a single parcel using a mobile device
abstract: This paper proposes methods for measuring size and distance of target objects
  by using mobile devices. For close-range measurement of a size of an object, users
  must hold the device close to the object and drag it along a desired direction.
  We develop a new approach for estimating a dragging distance of the device using
  acceleration signals retrieved from a three-axis accelerometer embedded on it. In
  the cases that target objects locate far from the device, users have to drag it
  vertically and two images of the objects are captured at starting and ending points
  of a dragging period. Then, the device displacement is estimated using acceleration
  signals, and a disparity of the object in two images is also determined via a matching
  technique based on Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF). The object disparity, dragging
  distance and device orientation are used as features to determine a distance between
  the target object and the device and also a size of it using learning-based scheme.
  Experimental results are presented to demonstrate a performance of the proposed
  methods.
