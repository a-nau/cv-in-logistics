summary: Concept for damaged parcel detection with CNNs
abstract: In order to solve the problem of detecting damaged goods before delivery to the consignee, a method is proposed for identifying packaging in the cargo flow that has traces of deformation and other changes in appearance. As a result of the convergence of the skills and experience of specialists in the field of loading and unloading operations and the capabilities of artificial neural networks, it was possible to develop the concept of an intelligent system capable of detecting damaged packaging by analyzing the image received from CCTV cameras installed at the places of cargo operations. A convolutional neural network is recognized as optimal for solving the problem, and a description of the functions of its layers is given. In the course of the study, the existing methods for detecting damaged goods were described, characteristic signs of a change in the appearance of the package as a result of the influence of various negative factors were identified, the basic requirements for video cameras from which the image was entered into the neural network were formulated, and a scheme for placing video cameras and areas of image fixation was proposed and described. The proposed model can be implemented without installing additional expensive equipment and makes it possible to dispense with the introduction of accessory operations into the process of cargo transportation.
