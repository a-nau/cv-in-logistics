summary: damage and tampering detection in a postal security framework by extracting 3D shape and appearance information from multiple cameras
abstract: In this paper, we describe a multi-camera system for parcel inspection which detects signs of damages and cues of tampering. The proposed system has been developed within the EU project SAFEPOST as a part of a multi-sensor scanning modality, to enhance safety and security of parcels travelling on the European Postal Supply Chain. Our work addresses in particular the safety of valuable goods, whose presence on the postal supply chain is in steady growth. The method we propose is based on extracting 3D shape and appearance information, detecting in real-time signs of damages or tampering, and storing the model for future comparative analysis when required by the system. We provide an experimental evidence of the effectiveness of the method, both in laboratory and field tests.
