summary: ''
abstract: Industrial logistics may benefit from object perception to perform flexible
  and efficient management of goods. This paper illustrates and experimentally compares
  two approaches to parcel box detection in depth images for an industrial depalletization
  task. The model-based method detects clusters in the input point cloud according
  to curvature and other geometric features, and aggregates the candidate objects.
  The learning-based method relies on the state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN, which has been
  re-trained on an acquired dataset with missing measurements. The target object poses
  are evaluated through standard geometric registration. The experiments on acquired
  datasets show the feasibility of the two approaches.
