summary: operator safety and evaluate the performance of a 2D laser scanner
abstract: The so-called fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) we are facing at present let emerge powerful tools and new technologies; due to the high frequency of accidents that happen at the workplace related to these innovations, necessarily new devices are continuously developed to enhance the operators' safety. Among these, we find the laser scanner, a sensor able to detect the presence of objects by scanning its surrounding area. The aim of this paper is to test its effectiveness through some tests carried out at the University of Parma, and to present an economic evaluation for an investment in this technology.
