summary: detecting barcodes in images
abstract: In the last decades, many approaches were presented to localize and decode
  barcodes in images from off the shelf cameras. However, all proposed solutions usually
  only deal with one type of image artifacts, such as a poorly illuminated or noisy
  image, or an image that suffers from motion or out-of-focus blur. In this paper,
  we present a complete, fully automatic pipeline, which allows the localization and
  decoding of barcodes in real-world scenarios. Our method is capable of localization
  and decoding the correct barcode information even if the input image is noisy, poorly
  exposed, and blurred at the same time. We can also decode the correct information
  from barcode images whose resolution is actually too low, i.e., where the width
  of the smallest bar depicted is smaller than the width of a single pixel.
