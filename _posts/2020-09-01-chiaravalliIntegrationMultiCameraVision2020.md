summary: depalletizing using a robot with a fixed time-of-flight camera and an eye-in-hand RGB camera
abstract: This work addresses the task of robot depalletizing by means of a mobile manipulator, taking into account the problem of localizing the boxes to be removed from the pallet and a manipulation strategy that allows to pull the boxes without lifting them with the robot arm. The depalletizing task is of particular interest in the industrial scenario in order to increase efficiency, flexibility and economic affordability of automatic warehouses.The proposed solution makes use of a multi-sensor vision system and a force-controlled collaborative robot in order to detect the boxes on the pallet and to control the robot interaction with the boxes to be removed. The vision system comprises a fixed 3D Time-of-flight camera and an eye-in-hand 2D camera. Preliminary experimental results performed on a laboratory setup with a fixed-based robotic manipulator are reported to show the effectiveness of the perception and control system.
