summary: re-identification for chipwood pallet blocks of Euro pallets
abstract: This contribution provides a novel graph representation-based approach for
  the re-identification of chipwood surface structures and, in the herein observed
  use case, the re-identification of Euro-pallets. For this purpose, we suggest, in
  contrast to common re-identification approaches, replacing the usual image representation
  with a highly compressed graph representation. This allows for the creation of an
  efficient algorithm while also providing robustness to environmental changes such
  as rotation and shearing. The resulting method, called IRAG (Image Representation
  through Anomaly Graphs), is a siamese graph neural network, that is applied on a
  previously published dataset consisting of images from 502 EPAL pallet blocks. The
  results of this approach lead to a rank-1 accuracy of 27\% when re-identifying pallet
  blocks. Even though IRAG does not yet reach accuracy values that are comparable
  to state-of-the-art literature, it is however more efficient, concerning the handling
  and representation of data. In addition, the experiments in this work demonstrate
  that the re-identification accuracy of the model is not affected by rotation or
  shearing, demonstrating the model’s invariance to these environmental changes.
