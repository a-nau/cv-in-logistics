summary: pallet recognition and localization by using an RGBD camera
abstract: This article reports our research results on an autonomous forklift, with
  the focus on pallet recognition and localization using an RGB-D camera. It is a
  fundamental issue for unmanned storehouses, which enables the forklift to insert
  the forks within the palletâ€™s slots for loading and unloading packages. Particularly,
  a pallet recognition and localization approach is presented. The range image is
  firstly segmented into planar patches based on a region growing algorithm. Then,
  the segments are filtered heuristically according to the storehouse environment.
  Afterward, a template matching method is utilized to recognize pallets in the remained
  segments, based on calculating the degree of similarity at each location during
  sliding the templates on the segment. Once a pallet has been recognized, its pose
  is calculated straightforward. The article has three main contributions, that is,
  a low-cost RGB-D camera is employed for pallet recognition and localization, where
  only depth information has been utilized; using the proposed method, multiple kinds
  of pallets can be used at the same time, which provides a flexibility for the storehouse;
  and furthermore, the method has a good expansibility to allow the storehouse to
  adopt new pallets easily.
