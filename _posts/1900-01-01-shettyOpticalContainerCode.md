summary: Framework for OCR on containers
abstract: Container terminal operators worldwide have expressed the need for accurate
  real-time accounting of the incoming, outgoing and existing inventory. Container
  Optical Code Recognition (OCR) provides systems which can be integrated with RFID
  tags in order to give more accurate information to Maritime Supply Chain Management.
  The implementation of OCR systems for feasible identification and tracking of containers
  offers value added benefits. Container terminals utilizing OCR technology enjoy
  more efficient use of labor, yard space, and handling equipment while realizing
  improved productivity and profitability. This paper explains the development of
  the next generation of OCR systems using global image processing, hierarchical representations,
  probabilistic object tracking, color model transformation, statistical classifiers,
  neural networks, support vector machines, and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Their
  fusion with RFID technology and the utilization of the recent wireless technologies
  integrated with iPADs allow for the deployment of very sophisticated but still cost
  effective systems.
