summary: Label recognition by first detecting barcodes and then using this information
  for angle calibration
abstract: Shipping labels are widely used in logistics. It is important to ensure
  the quality of printing label and to verify contents of the shipping label on the
  package. We developed a verification and recognition method for various types of
  shipping labels by using deep neural networks. The experimental results showed 96\%
  recognition accuracy in rotation-invariant conditions. Also, we introduce Google
  Maps API for validating the address which can reduce the cost of returning packages
  due to the invalid address. To train and evaluate the method, we have generated
  and collected 25 different types of shipping label dataset. We plan to release the
  dataset on our website1.
